## Minkube Design Concept

Minkube is a distributed task management system. This document outlines its core design principles.

### Manager

The Manager is responsible for distributing tasks to available Worker nodes.

*   **Worker Selection:** It selects a Worker to receive a task using a round-robin strategy.
*   **Task Assignment:** It sends an HTTP request to the chosen Worker's API to assign the task and awaits a response.
*   **Failure Considerations:** The Manager is designed with the understanding that Workers might fail due to various reasons, such as:
    *   Failure to pull or use a specified Docker image.
    *   Bugs within the Docker container causing it to fail on startup.
    *   Insufficient disk space on the Worker node.

### Worker

Workers execute the tasks assigned by the Manager.

*   **State Management:** Each Worker stores its state, including the IDs of tasks assigned to it, in memory (primarily using a map data structure).
*   **Fault Tolerance:** This in-memory storage of task IDs aims to provide fault tolerance. If the Manager node fails, a Worker retains information about the tasks it is expected to perform.
*   **Performance:** Local storage of task IDs allows for faster access, as the Worker does not need to make a network round trip to the Manager to retrieve this information.
*   **Data Reconciliation:** Periodically, each Worker reconciles its local task database with the Manager's task database to ensure consistency.

### Planned Enhancements & System Details

#### Distributed Key-Value Store for Tasks
*   **TODO:** Implement a distributed key-value store for managing task data. This store will be shared between the Manager and Workers, aiming to improve data consistency, fault tolerance, and overall system scalability.

#### CPU Utilization Measurement
*   For measuring CPU utilization, the initial approach considered using Performance Monitoring Counters. However, due to unavailability in the target cloud VM environment, the implementation was switched to reading CPU statistics from the `/proc/stat` file.

#### Task Definition and Lifecycle
*   **(Placeholder for Task Details)**
    *   *This section will detail the structure of a task, its possible states, and how its lifecycle is managed within the system.*

#### Service Discovery
*   **Current Approach:** Workers currently register themselves with the Manager upon startup. This is achieved by the Worker sending an HTTP request to a registration endpoint on the Manager, which then adds the Worker to its list of available nodes.
*   **Alternative Approaches Considered:**
    *   Utilizing a dedicated service discovery tool (e.g., Consul).
    *   Implementing DNS-based service discovery, similar to how Kubernetes resolves service IP addresses.
*   **TODO:** Implement DNS-based service discovery as the preferred method for a more robust and scalable solution.



1. Security & Authentication
API Authentication
API Keys: Simple token-based auth for service-to-service communication
JWT Tokens: For user sessions with expiration and refresh mechanisms
mTLS (Mutual TLS): For secure worker-to-manager communication
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Different permissions for admins, developers, operators
Network Security
TLS Everywhere: Encrypt all HTTP traffic (manager ↔ workers, client ↔ manager)
Network Segmentation: Workers in private subnets, manager in DMZ
Firewall Rules: Restrict port access between components
VPN/Bastion: Secure access to management interfaces
2. Observability & Monitoring
Metrics & Monitoring
Prometheus/Grafana: System metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
Application Metrics: Task queue size, success/failure rates, response times
Worker Health: Track worker availability, resource usage, container counts
Alerting: PagerDuty/Slack integration for critical issues
Logging
Structured Logging: JSON logs with correlation IDs
Centralized Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or similar
Log Levels: DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR with configurable levels
Audit Logging: Track all API calls, task creations, configuration changes
Distributed Tracing
Jaeger/Zipkin: Track requests across manager → worker → container lifecycle
Request Correlation: Unique IDs to follow a task through the entire system
3. High Availability & Resilience
Manager High Availability
Multiple Manager Instances: Active-passive or active-active clustering
Load Balancer: HAProxy/NGINX for manager instances
Shared State: External database (PostgreSQL) or distributed cache (Redis Cluster)
Leader Election: Consensus algorithm for active manager selection
Data Persistence
Database: Move from in-memory maps to PostgreSQL/MySQL
Redis: For caching and session storage
Backup Strategy: Automated database backups with point-in-time recovery
Circuit Breakers & Retry Logic
Graceful Degradation: Handle worker failures without cascading
Exponential Backoff: Smart retry strategies for failed operations
Bulkhead Pattern: Isolate failures (one worker failure doesn't affect others)
4. Scalability & Performance
Horizontal Scaling
Manager Clustering: Multiple manager instances behind load balancer
Worker Auto-scaling: Dynamic worker registration/deregistration
Database Sharding: Partition task data across multiple databases
Message Queues: Redis/RabbitMQ for task distribution at scale
Resource Management
Resource Quotas: Limit CPU/memory per tenant or project
Priority Queues: High/medium/low priority task scheduling
Resource Monitoring: Track and alert on resource exhaustion
Auto-scaling Workers: Spin up/down workers based on queue depth
5. Configuration & Deployment
Configuration Management
Environment-based Configs: Dev/staging/prod configurations
Secret Management: HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets
Feature Flags: Toggle features without deployments
Hot Reloading: Update configurations without restarts
Deployment Strategy
Blue-Green Deployments: Zero-downtime deployments
Rolling Updates: Gradual rollout with health checks
Canary Releases: Test new versions with small traffic percentage
Database Migrations: Version-controlled schema changes
6. API & Interface Design
API Design
Versioning: /v1/, /v2/ API versioning strategy
Rate Limiting: Prevent API abuse with token bucket algorithms
Pagination: Handle large result sets efficiently
OpenAPI/Swagger: API documentation and client generation
User Interfaces
Web Dashboard: Task monitoring, worker status, system metrics
CLI Tool: Command-line interface for operators
API Documentation: Interactive API explorer
Status Pages: Public status page for system health
7. Data & State Management
Database Design
Task History: Persistent storage of completed tasks
Worker Registry: Dynamic worker discovery and health tracking
User Management: Store user accounts, permissions, quotas
Audit Trail: Track all system changes and API calls
State Consistency
ACID Transactions: Ensure data consistency across operations
Event Sourcing: Store events rather than current state
CQRS: Separate read/write models for performance
Data Retention: Automatic cleanup of old task data
8. Compliance & Governance
Security Compliance
SOC 2: Security controls and auditing
GDPR: Data privacy and user rights
Encryption: Data at rest and in transit
Access Logs: Track who accessed what and when
Operational Compliance
Change Management: Approval processes for production changes
Disaster Recovery: Backup and restore procedures
SLA Monitoring: Track and report on service level agreements
Incident Response: Playbooks for handling outages
9. Cost & Resource Optimization
Resource Efficiency
Auto-scaling: Scale resources based on demand
Spot Instances: Use cheaper cloud instances for workers
Resource Pooling: Share resources across tenants efficiently
Usage Analytics: Track and optimize resource consumption
Cost Monitoring
Cost Allocation: Track costs per tenant/project
Resource Quotas: Prevent runaway resource usage
Budget Alerts: Notify when costs exceed thresholds
Implementation Priority
Phase 1 (Foundation):

TLS encryption, basic authentication, structured logging, database persistence
Phase 2 (Reliability):

High availability, monitoring/alerting, circuit breakers, backup strategy
Phase 3 (Scale):

Horizontal scaling, advanced monitoring, performance optimization
Phase 4 (Enterprise):

Advanced security, compliance, multi-tenancy, governance
Each of these areas represents a significant engineering effort, but they're what separates a proof-of-concept from a production-ready system that can handle real workloads reliably and securely.
